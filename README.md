Flatland
========

A prototype for a physics-based game idea written by Marc Lepage in a few months in 2003. The idea was it might be fun to flick things around the screen (Pocket PC or Palm) like air hockey or shuffleboard or pinball. Sort of an Angry Birds before its time.

Because this was in the days before Box2D, development started out by writing a simple physics engine. Basically, this was like a 2D version of Quake, using polygonal brushes/models/entities, and parametric equation solving to compute collisions. Good times.

Windows executables are provided for each milestone release. Instructions are in the release notes below. Enjoy!

Milestone 1 - Aug 01, 2003
--------------------------

Basic geometry is working, you can see a hardcoded map with entities and scroll around a bit.
